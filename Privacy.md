Eclipse Tab ("we", "our", or "us") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage
**We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on our servers.**

* **Local Storage:** All data generated by Eclipse Tab, including your Zen Shelf notes, stickers, Focus Spaces configurations, Dock apps, and custom wallpapers, is stored strictly on your local device using your browser's `localStorage` and `IndexedDB` technologies.
* **No Cloud Sync:** We do not have a backend server. Your data never leaves your browser environment unless you manually export it.

## 2. External Services
Eclipse Tab interacts with third-party services only in the following specific scenarios:
* **Search Suggestions:** When you type in the search bar, your query is sent directly to the selected search engine provider (e.g., Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) to retrieve auto-completion suggestions.
* **Favicons:** To display website icons in the Dock, the extension may fetch images from the target website.

## 3. User Consent
By installing and using Eclipse Tab, you consent to the local processing of data as described in this policy.
